## Important Notes

### File Structure
Your project is a static site, so all files should be in the root directory:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html (main entry point)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vercel.json (for Vercel)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### Domain Configuration
- Most platforms provide a free subdomain
- You can add custom domains in platform settings
- SSL certificates are provided automatically

### Environment Variables
This project doesn't require environment variables, but if you add server-side features later, you can configure them in:
- Vercel: Project Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
- Netlify: Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables

### Performance Tips
- All assets are already optimized
- Consider adding a CDN for global distribution
- Monitor Core Web Vitals after deployment

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"No Output Directory" Error (Vercel):**
- Solution: The `vercel.json` file is already configured
- Make sure all files are in the root directory

**404 Errors:**
- Check that `index.html` is in the root directory
- Verify file paths are relative (not absolute)

**CSS/JS Not Loading:**
- Ensure file paths use forward slashes `/`
- Check that files are in the same directory as `index.html`

**Audio Not Playing on Mobile:**
- This is normal - browsers require user interaction first
- The app handles this automatically

## Post-Deployment Testing

After deployment, test these features:
- [ ] Audio file upload and playback
- [ ] All control buttons work
- [ ] Search functionality
- [ ] Drag and drop
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts
